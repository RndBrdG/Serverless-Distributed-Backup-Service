# Serverless-Distributed-Backup-Service
[SDIS] - 1st Project

# General idea
The idea is to use the unused disk space of the computers in a LAN for backing up files in other computers in the same LAN. The service is provided by servers, one per computer, in an environment that is assumed cooperative (rather than hostile). Each server retains control over its own disks and, if needed, may reclaim the space it made available for backing up other computers' files.
